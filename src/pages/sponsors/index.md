        Elevation Cycles. They build bikes. They sell bikes. They put them back
        together when you break the bikes so you can keep on keeping on with
        your bike hobby. We love bikes and we love Elevation.

        HiFi Wheels. They're the wheel deal. We wheel-y like what they have to
        offer, especially Andrew Wheelchair when he does his wheelies. Fredd
        tends to break a lot of these.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
